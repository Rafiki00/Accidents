# Accidents

This is the code for a Shiny App that displays an interactive graph to show the number of vehicle accidents in Valencia during a ten year period (2007-2017). The data is separated into districts that the user can select and compare. 

The data comes from the Annual Statistics from the city of Valencia, Spain. (https://bit.ly/2RG7OaR)
The 10 excel files for each year have been included. The preprocessing was done with the script analysis.R, that outputs a clean, unified dataset called "acc.csv".
You can see the final version of the Shiny app at the link above at: https://rafiki00.shinyapps.io/Accidents/

In addition to this app I wrote an article on Medium with other plots to talk about the topic:https://medium.com/@rafa94el/valencia-accidents-data-f19e4362f7b3
